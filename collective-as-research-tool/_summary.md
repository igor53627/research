# Summary: Collective as Research Tool

**Research Focus**: Evaluating the claude-code-sub-agent-collective framework as a structured methodology for technical research, comparing it to traditional single-agent AI assistance.

**Key Question**: Does the collective's hub-and-spoke coordination, TDD enforcement, and Context7 integration provide measurably better research outcomes?

**Methodology**: Comparative analysis running parallel experiments using both traditional and collective approaches, measuring efficiency, quality, accuracy, and reproducibility.

**Status**: Research framework established, experiments planned but not yet executed.

**Interesting Aspect**: Meta-research project - using the collective to study the collective's effectiveness for research!
