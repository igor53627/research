# FrodoPIR for Ethereum JSON-RPC: Feasibility Analysis

**Research Question**: Can FrodoPIR be practically applied to provide Private Information Retrieval for Ethereum public JSON-RPC endpoints, enabling users to query blockchain data without revealing their queries?

**Started**: 2025-11-09
**Status**: Active Investigation

## Hypothesis

FrodoPIR's single-server, LWE-based PIR scheme could enable privacy-preserving Ethereum RPC queries by treating blockchain state/history as a database, potentially protecting user query patterns from RPC providers while maintaining reasonable performance.

## Background

### What is FrodoPIR?

FrodoPIR is a stateful, single-server Private Information Retrieval (PIR) scheme developed by Brave that allows clients to query databases without revealing what they're searching for. Named after Frodo from *The Lord of the Rings*, it enables "hidden queries" to servers.

**Key Innovation**: Uses pure Learning With Errors (LWE) cryptography without FHE, achieving:
- 170x database compression during offline phase
- Sub-second query responses for million-record databases
- Post-quantum security
- Simple modular arithmetic (no complex FHE operations)

**Two-Phase Protocol**:
1. **Offline Phase**: Server compresses database into public parameters; clients download and precompute query parameters (client-independent)
2. **Online Phase**: Clients send encrypted query vectors; server multiplies against database matrix and returns results

### Ethereum JSON-RPC Context

Ethereum JSON-RPC is the standard interface for querying blockchain data:
- `eth_getBalance`, `eth_call`, `eth_getTransactionReceipt`, etc.
- Users typically connect to public RPC providers (Infura, Alchemy, QuickNode)
- **Privacy Problem**: RPC providers can track which addresses users query, revealing user interests and holdings

**Current Privacy Limitations**:
- Running full nodes is expensive (1+ TB storage, high bandwidth)
- Light clients still reveal query patterns to serving nodes
- VPNs/Tor only hide IP, not query content

## Research Objectives

### Primary Questions

1. **Feasibility**: Can FrodoPIR's database model map to Ethereum state/history queries?
2. **Performance**: Would query latency be acceptable for wallet/dApp usage?
3. **Scalability**: Can it handle Ethereum's data size and update frequency?
4. **Cost**: What are the computational/bandwidth costs for clients and servers?
5. **Practicality**: What implementation challenges would arise?

### Secondary Questions

6. How do Rust vs C++ implementations compare for this use case?
7. What specific Ethereum RPC calls are viable with FrodoPIR?
8. How often would offline phase need regeneration (blockchain updates)?
9. What privacy guarantees actually achieved in practice?
10. Could this be integrated into existing wallets/libraries (ethers.js, web3.py)?

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Technical Analysis

## Initial Findings

### FrodoPIR Characteristics (from sources)

**Performance** (Rust implementation, 1M KB database):
- Query response: <1 second
- Server response size: >3.6x blow-up factor
- Financial cost: ~$1 for answering client queries
- Database compression: ~170x smaller than original

**Performance** (C++ implementation, 1GB database - 2^20 entries × 1KB):
- Server setup: 46.7s (ARM) / 67.7s (x86)
- Client query: 146 microseconds (ARM) / 454 microseconds (x86)
- Database encoding: <3.5x blow-up
- Server response bandwidth: 55.24 GB/s (ARM) / 32.46 GB/s (x86)

**Tested Configurations**:
- Database sizes: 2^16 to 2^20 items
- Element sizes: 8KB per record
- LWE dimension: 1572
- Plaintext bits: 9-10 bits depending on log₂(m)

**Limitations**:
- Requires honest-but-curious server assumption
- Database must be public (Ethereum state is public ✓)
- Stateful design with offline phase requirement
- Single-server (no multi-server security)
- Research prototype ("do not use in production")

### Ethereum State/RPC Characteristics

**State Size** (as of 2025):
- Full archive node: >12 TB
- Full node (pruned): ~1 TB
- Number of accounts: ~250 million
- Active accounts: ~50 million

**Common RPC Calls**:
- `eth_getBalance(address)` - 32 bytes response
- `eth_call(to, data)` - variable response
- `eth_getTransactionReceipt(hash)` - ~500 bytes
- `eth_getCode(address)` - variable (contracts)
- `eth_getStorageAt(address, slot)` - 32 bytes

**Query Patterns**:
- Wallet: Check 5-10 addresses periodically
- DeFi dashboard: Query 20-50 addresses + storage slots
- NFT viewer: Query ownership + metadata URIs
- Block updates: Every 12 seconds

## Preliminary Analysis

### Potential Viability

**Promising Aspects**:
✓ Ethereum state is public (fits FrodoPIR's database publicity requirement)
✓ Many queries are simple lookups (address → balance)
✓ Response sizes often small (32 bytes for balance)
✓ Sub-second queries could be acceptable for non-real-time use
✓ Post-quantum security aligns with blockchain's long-term value

**Challenges Identified**:
❌ State updates every 12 seconds (offline phase regeneration?)
❌ Database size (250M accounts = massive offline download)
❌ Variable-size responses (contract calls)
❌ Real-time requirements for some dApps
❌ Client computation on mobile devices
❌ Multi-query patterns (wallet checks multiple addresses)

### Critical Questions

1. **Database Scope**: Full state vs subset?
   - Option A: Full state (250M accounts) → massive offline phase
   - Option B: Popular/active accounts only → reduces privacy set
   - Option C: Time-windowed data (recent blocks) → smaller, needs updates

2. **Update Frequency**:
   - Regenerate offline phase every block? (12s) → too expensive
   - Regenerate daily? → stale data
   - Differential updates? → complex protocol extension

3. **Query Granularity**:
   - Per-account queries → manageable
   - Per-storage-slot queries → state explosion
   - Contract calls with computation → doesn't fit PIR model

### Implementation Comparison

**Rust (brave-experiments/frodo-pir)**:
- Official implementation by authors
- Simpler API, clearer code structure
- Better for research and prototyping
- Research prototype warning
- Docker support for testing

**C++ (itzmeanjan/frodoPIR)**:
- Header-only, zero dependencies
- Significantly faster (ARM: 3.1x faster queries)
- Production-optimization friendly
- More complex integration
- Better for performance-critical deployment

## Next Steps

### Experiments to Run

## Expected Outcomes

### Best Case

FrodoPIR proves viable for specific Ethereum RPC use cases:
- Balance/storage queries for known account sets
- Historical data lookups (non-real-time)
- Privacy-focused wallets willing to trade latency for privacy
- Potential integration into next-gen light clients

### Realistic Case

FrodoPIR works but with significant limitations:
- Only viable for subset of RPC calls
- Requires hybrid approach (PIR + direct queries)
- High offline phase overhead limits update frequency
- Suitable for specific high-privacy scenarios only

### Worst Case

FrodoPIR fundamentally incompatible with Ethereum RPC:
- State size too large for practical offline phase
- Update frequency incompatible with 12s blocks
- Query patterns don't map to database index model
- Performance unacceptable for user experience

**Even negative results are valuable** - documenting what doesn't work guides future privacy research.
